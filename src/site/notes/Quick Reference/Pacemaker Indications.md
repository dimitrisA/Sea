### **General Principles**

- Indicated for **symptomatic bradyarrhythmias** after excluding reversible causes (drugs, ischemia, vagal states, metabolic abnormalities).
- Also indicated if rate-slowing drugs are required for SVT and produce symptomatic bradycardia.

## Atrioventricular (AV) Blocks

- Symptomatic pauses ≥ 3 s (while awake)
- Symptomatic bradycardia < 50 bpm with AV block (while awake)
- Mobitz II second-degree AV block (even if asymptomatic)
- AF pause > 5 s (while awake)
- First degree AV block or Mobitz I with symptoms of "pacemaker syndrome" (typically PR at least 300 ms)
- 2:1 AV block, very long PR, Mobitz I with unclear symptoms/location (e.g. wide QRS). Perform diagnostic testing (Holter, exercise test, or EPS). Infranodal block mandates pacing after ischemia exclusion.

## Sinus Node Dysfunction

- Symptomatic pauses ≥ 3 s (while awake). Theophylline may be trialed in select cases. 
- Symptomatic bradycardia < 40 bpm without AV block (while awake)
- Intermittent AF with symptomatic pauses after termination. (AF ablation may obviate need)
- Chronotropic incompetence, documented on stress testing
- Unexplained syncope with cardioinhibitory carotid sinus hypersensitivity (pause > 3 s on carotid sinus massage). Pacemaker indicated even without spontaneous syncope.
- Unexplained syncope with severe sinus node dysfunction on EPS. EPS is insensitive; prolonged monitoring is preferred

## Bundle Branch Blocks (BBBs)

Asymptomatic RBBB/LBBB/bifascicular/trifascicular block need no pacing, unless advanced AV block develops (progression risk ~1-4%/year).
- Alternating RBBB and LBBB (Pacing warranted even if asymptomatic)
- Unexplained, non-neurally mediated syncope in patient with RBBB or LBBB. Likely paroxysmal AV block; pacing reasonable (**ACC/AHA Class IIa**). PRESS study: pacing ↓ syncope recurrence by 60%. EPS mainly to exclude inducible VT (present in ~14–30%).
- Rate-dependent BBB at lower HR (<130 bpm). Managed as non–rate-related BBB
- Bradycardia or pause-dependent BBB/AV block. Suggests infranodal disease → pacing indicated.

## Other clinical settings

- Post-TAVR AV block persisting > 24 h. Unlikely to resolve; pacing indicated. Baseline RBBB is strongest predictor. New persistent post-TAVR LBBB → 30-day monitoring (15% progress to AV block).
- Recurrent vasovagal syncope with asystolic pauses. May be considered if ≥3 s symptomatic or ≥6 s asymptomatic pauses; ≥3 s symptomatic pause on tilt test + age >40 supports pacing (**Class IIb–IIa**).
- Carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH). Dual-chamber pacing indicated if documented. **Class IIa** for dual-chamber pacing.
- Bradycardia/pause-dependent TdP or polymorphic VT (not resolving after K⁺ correction/drug withdrawal). Permanent pacemaker indicated.
