#pacemakers
### **General Principles**

Four letter code.
1) Chamber paced
2) Chamber sensed
3) Action event sensed ( I - inhibits, T - triggers)
4) Rate-response mode (R), means the device has accelerometer or ventilatory sensors that increase rate with activity of patient

## VVI

Common indications:
- Chronic AF, where atrium cannot be sensed or paced.
- Can be acceptable in older sedentary patients with **AV block**. They can tolerate the loss of atrial contribution to CO.

Key programming aspects:
- *Lower rate interval (LRI)*. A limit of 1 sec corresponds to 60 bpm. It is the interval between two QRS complexes. If it takes longer, PM paces.

Usual issues:
- **PM syndrome**. Due to incr. intra-atrial pressure either from asynchronous atrial contractions or from retrograde atrial stimulation (retrograde P waves). Atrial contribution to CO also lost. Sx include fatigue/dyspnea, pre-syncope/syncope.

## DDD

> [!Idea] Function
> DDD = AAI + VAT + VVI

General aspects:
- More physiologic pacing.
- In pure SND one can theoretically place an AAI PM only. However, AV node disease may coexist now or in the future. 
- To avoid RV pacing when AV node is ok, set AV interval high (250 ms if tolerated).

Key programming aspects:
- *Programmed AV interval*. How long after a P wave to wait before pacing the ventricle
- VAT function or AV sequential pacing means that PM senses the atrium (A), then triggers (T) the ventricle (V).
- Will track sinus rate up to *upper tracking rate*.
- *Mode switch* function. If AF develops, DDD senses and switches pacing to VVI or DDI.

ECG appearance:
- Wide QRS with LBBB pattern. Axis left. Or vertical if RVOT pacing.
- QRS should be negative in V1-V3. However, up to 10% may have positive in V1-V2, *but never in V3*.
- Positive in V3 means *LV pacing and thus BiV pacing* or *septal perforation of the RV lead*.

## Biventricular PM (BiV)

Also called CRT. 

General aspects:
- Generally used in HFrEF pts who are not bradycardic.
- If HFrEF pts require PM for bradycardia, and when the ventricle is expected to be paced frequently (>40%), BiV instead of RV PM seems the best option regardless of NYHA class.
